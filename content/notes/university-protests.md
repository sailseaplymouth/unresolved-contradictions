The anti-genocide{{< fn "The fact that such a thing as an anti-genocide protest exists is a horrifying prospect. That should be a default position. There is never a justification for genocide." >}} protests that have swept through US universities in recent months have perfectly encapsulated the weakness in the position of the US establishment.

Students at various campuses decided to target their protests by highlighting the investments their universities hold in Israeli companies. These protests were peaceful, the students set up tents in green spaces around campuses, encouraged people to bring food and donate to pro-Palestine causes. Their intent was to encourage their universities, to whom they are paying exorbitant fees, to divest from companies based in a nation that is perpetuating a genocide. As a tactic, this was hugely impactful in the march against the South African apartheid regime.

Playing out the Principal Skinner "Am I out of touch? No it's the children who are wrong" scene, university administrators made just about every poor decision they could. In an effort to appease Republican lawmakers whose negative-nationalist stance is to oppose anything and everything those in power are doing, the president of Columbia University decided to bring in police to stop the protests. Surprising nobody, ever the experts in escalating situations unnecessarily, the police attempted to remove the protestors in the only way they know how. Violently. Administrators at various universities decided to take the same stance as Columbia, egged on by lawmakers intent on chaos, which further fuelled the flames. At points, snipers were placed on buildings around campuses to deter would-be campers from setting up their encampments, it felt like another Kent State massacre was only days away. Campus radio stations were shut down, journalists were banned from covering the events. What started as a small-scale protest in a single university quickly spread, first throughout the US and then into Europe

It is clear that nobody in these universities has an understanding of the Streisand Effect; the idea that bringing attention to a negative story or act will only serve as a catalyst, spreading it far beyond where it would have otherwise gone. Universities needed to do nothing. Let the peaceful protestors continue in their attempt to spread their message. Time and circumstance{{< fn "At the time the protests started, final exams were mere weeks away." >}} would have wrapped things up much quicker and with far less backlash. Instead they made the decision to [expand the conflict](https://davekarpf.substack.com/p/the-only-thing-university-administrators?r=eeyg).

University administrations have broken the trust their students place in them. By aligning with the political classes on the subject of Israel and Palestine, Universities have opened their students to violence and aggression. Students are, and always will be, staunchly socially liberal and morally steadfast. For decades student protests have been on the right side of history, and it seems once again university leaderships have shown themselves to be defenders of the status quo. Their role should be to encourage environments that foster change and conversation, while defending them from the whims of populist governments and legislatures.
