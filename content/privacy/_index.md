I care about protecting my own privacy online and I believe I should do the same for my guests. This site does not utilise any cookies or trackers and I do not make use of any analytics that collect identifiable data. My hosting provider, Cloudflare, provides some very basic analytics in the form of number of page views. You can view their [privacy policy](https://www.cloudflare.com/service-specific-terms-developer-platform/#developer-platform-terms) if you want more information.
