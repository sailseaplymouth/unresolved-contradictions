Welcome to my little corner of the internet. In recent years I've been encouraged to write my thoughts and ideas down somewhere; This will, hopefully, become that somewhere. My interests vary, but I am mostly interested in politics, economics, tech and privacy. 

This started as a more traditional blog but I quickly found myself struggling to write. I was being overly critical of myself, insisting that anything I posted needed to be perfect and well curated. My notes started to pile up as I had ideas, but they never went anywhere and I ended up with a ton of half-baked essays I wasn't happy with. Ultimately, this then put me off writing altogether.

I stumbled across the idea of a digital garden{{< fn "The concept and history of the idea is summed up [here](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history) on Maggie Appleton's fantastic website." >}} which encourages a move away from chronologically ordered posts and ideas of perfection. Instead, creators are encouraged to [learn in public](https://www.swyx.io/learn-in-public),  posting notes as they develop, allowing thoughts to grow on the open internet.

## What I'm using
This website is generated via [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), a fantastically easy-to-use static site generator written in Go. I am using the [PaperMod](https://github.com/adityatelange/hugo-PaperMod) theme, albeit heavily modified to fit my vision a little better. The site is hosted via [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) which is connected via a [Github](https://github.com/sailseaplymouth) repository. When changes are committed, the site is automatically updated.

I use [Logseq](https://logseq.com/) as my personal knowledge base. I write all my notes using Logseq and because of its bi-directional linking ability, it is incredibly easy for me to connect concepts together and develop ideas more readily. From Logseq, I can export files directly to my website directory, streamlining the processes involved even further.
