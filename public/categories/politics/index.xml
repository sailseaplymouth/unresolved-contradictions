      <title>Is Violence the Answer?</title>

      <description>Was the toppling of the statue of Edward Colston a violent act, and what did it achieve?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I recently had an interesting conversation with a colleague at work. We were discussing the toppling of the statue of slave trader Edward Colston in Bristol in 2020 and the circumstances surrounding it. My colleague was sympathetic to the overall aims of the protestors, but believes that politics should be non-violent, and that by crossing the line from a peaceful protest, the protestors muddied and delegitimised their own aims. This view of politics is, in my mind, prohibitively restrictive and narrow.</p>
<p>This belief does match up with the passive nature of British political engagement that has permeated society for decades. We learn that a good citizen is someone that follows the rules, does not kick up a fuss, pays their taxes and votes in elections when asked. This needs to change—politics impacts us all and is something that needs active participation. We need to express our feelings, force the change we need to see and spread the power of politics amongst the population.</p>
<p>Where you stand on this point depends on your view of what counts as politics. Politics does not have a one-size-fits-all definition; It is an abstract concept that means something different to every person that you ask. I see politics as something that surrounds us—it impacts how much money we take home, the education and healthcare we receive, the people we can marry, the spaces we can use and the environment in which we live. Of course it is the political processes such as elections and voting, it is politicians and parliament, and the legislation they pass. But it is much, much more than this, too.</p>
<p>I believe that politics and violence are not mutually exclusive. Violence can be a legitimate form of protest—in places where traditional democratic means of engaging in politics are non-existent, ineffectual or dangerous it can be the only option available to citizens. But when does an act become political and not merely violent? Well, that is another one of those difficult to define areas and one that has different interpretations depending on your personal politics. One person&rsquo;s protest march is another person&rsquo;s violent riot. From my perspective, the toppling of the Colston statue was not a violent act. It was an event that captured the true nature of feeling at a time when the country was attempting to come to grips with its colonial past. When people cannot achieve their political and social goals through elected bodies, what options are open to them? Collective action.</p>
<p>Opposition to the Colston statue was not something that appeared spontaneously and violently during the BLM protests that swept the world in June 2020. Direct action against the statue dates back to the 1990s and in since then, MPs, councillors, activists and the public have all questioned whether it should still stand. Arguments against removing the statue follow a similar vein as groups protesting the removal of civil-war statues in the US—they saw these attempts as trying to re-write history. Stupid, frankly. Statues are erected, with the support of the public, to celebrate people that society feels are deserving of memorialising. To suggest that they should stand indefinitely and survive regardless of what we learn of the person is juvenile. Just as the statue is erected with support of the public, it should be removed if feelings change. History does not live and die in a statue.</p>
<p>When requests were made through legitimate means such as petitions and councillors, nothing changed. Even attempts at something as simple as changing the plaque on the statue to reflect Colston&rsquo;s slave-trading past were slowed by interest groups intent on defending his legacy. For the group that met in June 2020, taking action into their own hands was the only way they felt they could effectively engage in the politics of the matter. In the wake of this event, younger people nationally felt that they had achieved something important. Collective action achieved what activists had attempted to do for decades.</p>
<p>We hear again and again that people are not interested in politics, or that all the parties are the same and so they don&rsquo;t involve themselves in it. This is a huge problem for everyone, and for anyone legitimately interested in politics, greater participation should always be an end goal. We need people involved in politics from every part of society, taking an active interest and shaping the direction of policy.

<p>If we hold the narrow view that violence and politics are mutually exclusive, and closely police what is or isn&rsquo;t violent through stuffy British passivism, we only serve to exclude groups of society from the wider conversation. By expanding our understanding of what politics is, we can engage with it better and ensure favourable outcomes for all. People need to know how much politics impacts their lives, and that by not participating, their views will be left unheard. Political engagement does not need to be violent, but by accepting that it <em>can be</em> allows for a better understanding of what politics is, who engages in it and how these people can be effectively represented through traditional means.</p>
<p>Does this mean we need to rethink how we engage younger generations politically? Absolutely. The UK&rsquo;s prevailing two-party system means increasing interest in politics is not an easy task—if people do not relate to one party or the other, they will instead <a href="https://blogs.lse.ac.uk/politicsandpolicy/how-unfair-or-disproportionate-is-the-uk%E2%80%99s-voting-system-for-general-elections/" rel="external">not vote at all

This kickstarts a spiral of alienation whereby policies benefitting older generations exclude the younger generations, who feel ignored by the political classes and so stay away from traditional political engagement.</p>
<p>However, social media has allowed for new forms of expression and engagement to grow—petitions can spread like wildfire, contentious issues are debated widely, and organisation of like-minded individuals is much simpler than in years gone by. This rise in new-style politics needs to be capitalised upon and converted into traditional engagement in the form of voting, party membership and people running for office. While the political classes will resist any changes to the fundamentals of the UK political system, incremental change can be achieved if enough people push for it.</p>

      <description>Greg Hands needs a reality check, the Tories are heading for failure.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Doing what he does best and avoiding his responsibilities, Rishi Sunak managed to be busy on the day of a double by-election contesting two Tory safe seats yesterday. Perhaps he saw the writing on the wall, but the reality is still a shock. Labour managed to achieve the single greatest turnover of a majority in a by-election since 1945 in Mid Bedfordshire

<span class="sidenote">This is a testing footnote</span>, previously held by Nadine &lsquo;Dosser&rsquo; Dorries, while in Tamworth a similarly impressive 20,000 vote majority was overturned. The bad news continues for the Tories. I doubt any Tory MP will be particularly confident about keeping their job in next year&rsquo;s election.</p>
<p>One particularly striking thing with these two results was the collapse in turnout. In Tamworth, turnout was just 35%, nearly half that of the 2019 general election. By-elections generally do see lower numbers of voters hitting the polls as people see their vote is perhaps not that consequential to the wider national picture. But I think this is indicative of a deeper issue and we will see this throughout the country come GE 2024. Rather than vote for another party, staunch Tories will instead elect to stay at home, living the mantra of not my circus, not my monkeys.</p>
<p>With the Prime Minister conveniently out of the country and the rest of the Cabinet seemingly too busy to make an appearance, the Tory Party Chairman made the media rounds this morning. Predictably Greg Hands, the man whose comedic ability rivals that of a tax advisor at a funeral wake, said this result was not necessarily a depiction of Tory failings or Labour&rsquo;s strength. Apparently people in their droves were telling canvassers on the doorstep in Tamworth and Mid Bedfordshire that Labour and Kier Starmer are not what they want. Unfortunately for Mr Hands, they clearly don&rsquo;t want the Tories either. Come on Greg, it&rsquo;s time to think up a strategy a little more comprehensive than just <a href="https://twitter.com/CounterGreg" rel="external">misrepresenting ironic jokes

<p>People want their lives to improve, or at the very least, not get worse. It&rsquo;s hard to argue the nation has moved anywhere but backwards under the stewardship of the Tories and it seems the electorate are finally seeing it. These problems take time to manifest themselves. Initially, austerity hit the worst off the hardest, but more than a decade of underinvestment in the country is now rearing its head and becoming more evident by the day, impacting a wider selection of society and voters across the spectrum. Rishi doesn&rsquo;t give the public the confidence that he will change things.

<p>It&rsquo;s clear the Tories are in a death-spiral. It happens periodically with parties in the UK. Remember Labour&rsquo;s &rsquo;longest suicide note in history&rsquo; in the Thatcher years, or the sleaze and infighting in the Tory Party before 1997? It&rsquo;s the natural ebb and flow of a dominant two-party system and first past the post. The wheels are falling off the Rishi Wagon and there&rsquo;s no one to pick up the pieces and reunite the party now. The saving grace is that Rishi will not have the ability to pass anything overly ambitious or groundbreaking through parliament, he was the party&rsquo;s second choice and still doesn&rsquo;t command full support, and it seems their majority is dwindling by the day. It&rsquo;s very much Rishi&rsquo;s lame duck era.</p>
<p>He knows he won&rsquo;t be in the job for much longer despite the claims from himself and his cabinet that they&rsquo;re in this for the long haul. You have to feel sorry for them, why not end the pain now? Voters may not be entirely won over by Kier Starmer&rsquo;s rebranded Labour Party, but whether through abstention, or holding their nose and voting for &rsquo;the other side&rsquo;, I see the Tory vote collapsing at the next election. People will be hoping their lives will improve and it&rsquo;s clear the Tories can&rsquo;t or won&rsquo;t deliver that. If putting their trust in the Labour Party doesn&rsquo;t deliver the changes they&rsquo;re looking for, there could be some serious implications for politics in the UK in the years to come.</p>

      <title>The UK&#39;s Delivery Problem</title>

      <description>Why does it feel like nothing seems to happen despite what politicans tell us?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I saw a comment recently on an article about tax loopholes in the UK explaining that tax reform is dull for the electorate and boring for governments to implement so that&rsquo;s why it won&rsquo;t be dealt with any time soon. This kind of view is symptomatic of a host of the issues with politics in the UK and one that we&rsquo;ve been dealing with for decades.</p>
<p>The neoliberal shift that was instigated in 1979 and has held since, has given us a political situation whereby the electorate are promised a better life so long as the economy grows - a chicken and egg type situation, if you will. In this telling of things, the economy can only grow if governments take a &lsquo;hands off&rsquo; approach via deregulation, privatisation and reductions in government spending - the state is seen as a limit to economic growth. This view is so ingrained in the minds of the electorate that, for most, it is hard to see an alternative path. The circumstances under which Margaret Thatcher came to power in the late 70s and the state of the nation in the preceding decade imprinted a certain attitude towards the state on the minds of politicians and electorate alike.</p>
<p>Prior to this economic revolution of sorts, the Keynesian view that dominated economic theory from the mid 20th century onwards was that government spending can influence demand and support the economy. There was a belief that better living standards achieved through spending on infrastructure, unemployment benefits and education would contribute to a stronger economy. It&rsquo;s hard to discount this theory when you look at the relative prosperity of the 1950s and 1960s and the meteoric rise in living standards post World War 2. Unfortunately, economic literacy in the UK is left wanting thanks in part to intentional masquerading by politicians, and a friendly tabloid media aiding to imprint the inherent linguistic framing that twists the connection between the idea of growth and positivity.</p>
<p>The limited economic understanding among the population means that people are making electoral decisions based on skewed beliefs of national budgets, deficits and debt - usually backed up by media reporting. The majority of people in the UK <a href="https://yougov.co.uk/economy/articles/28349-brits-are-confused-economic-jargon" rel="external">cannot accurately define GDP
            <svg fill="none" shape-rendering="geometricPrecision" stroke="currentColor" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2.5" viewBox="0 0 24 24" height="12" width="12">

            </svg></a> or its affects on households, and believe that a nation&rsquo;s economy functions similar to that of a household budget, whereby there is a set amount of income that should be balanced by a comparable amount of outgoings. Continuing to run with this narrative benefits the parties when it comes to attacking their opposition&rsquo;s track-record. The Cameron premiership beginning in 2010 is a prime example, when we were told that the only way to prevent inevitable bankruptcy would be to implement an &lsquo;age of austerity&rsquo; which was the sole method of achieving a growing economy, higher wages and better lives.</p>
<p>UK politics is increasingly becoming a popularity contest. Every election since 1979 has been won by the party whose leader tops the popularity polls and, as examples like Gordon Brown and Ed Miliband show, competent politicians are often sidelined at elections because they lack charisma. It&rsquo;s understandable, and shows a fundamental problem with the Westminster system of politics. In the UK, convention says the leader of the most populous party in parliament takes the reigns. Given <a href="https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200607/cmselect/cmmodern/337/33706.htm" rel="external">not even MPs

            </svg></a> themselves can agree on the duties of the job or where their loyalties should lie, the easiest way through an election for the population is to vote for the party of the leader they want to be running the show. Unfortunately, as we&rsquo;ve settled into a comfortable two-party system, people feel their options are either Labour or the Tories and so we see tactical voting on a national scale which only serves to further disconnect the idea of an MP being a &rsquo;local&rsquo; representative.</p>
<p>So, we find ourselves in a place where political leaders need to be popular in order to get elected, and to do that they need to win the electorate over by promising fantastical economic growth, which they&rsquo;re told means higher wages and a better life. It makes sense, then, that politicians promise wide-ranging system change, or to disrupt the way things have been done, or huge infrastructure projects. These plans get the headlines which then stick in the minds of the electorate when it comes to election time. The issue comes when these promises are not delivered, either because they were over-promised initially, or they become prohibitively expensive, or the inter-connected nature of a modern nation is overlooked at the planning stage and what was originally promised becomes near impossible to actually achieve.</p>
<p>As parliament cannot bind its successors, every new Prime Minister comes into post ready to make their mark and push ahead with their premiership defining plans. The NHS and education are perfect examples of reform-churn. Reform is implemented, and then changed, chopped and reformed once again. A study of the NHS since the 1990s has shown that <a href="https://foundationaleconomycom.files.wordpress.com/2020/08/when-systems-fail-uk-acute-hospitals-and-public-health-after-covid-19.pdf" rel="external">less than 40%

What good does this never-ending churn do for us? How can the effectiveness of reform be properly understood if it&rsquo;s not even allowed to bed in? This cycle of endless change inevitably costs far more than it should, leaves us with services that are disorganised and underfunded and the prevailing neoliberal idea that government spending should be kept to a minimum leads to further problems.

<p>The problem with this constant promise of change through top-down reform is that it impacts the trust the electorate have in the politicians they vote for and erodes the social contract that exists between citizens and the state. There&rsquo;s an underlying understanding on the part of the electorate that the taxes they pay go towards the services they use. This connection, however, is being damaged and people are seeing less and less what they&rsquo;re getting in return for the taxes they pay. Despite <a href="https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/personalandhouseholdfinances/incomeandwealth/bulletins/theeffectsoftaxesandbenefitsonhouseholdincome/financialyearending2022" rel="external">more than 50%

            </svg></a> of the population receiving more in benefits, whether in-kind or cash, than they pay in taxes, the wide-spread condemnation of welfare recipients permeates society, driven on by opportunist politicians and a friendly media. We need to move back towards a time where people understand what they&rsquo;re getting for the taxes they pay; failure of these headline projects simply doesn&rsquo;t deliver this.</p>
<p>Reform takes time. The short terms of office in the UK mean that governments are not well equipped to turn things around in a single term of office. Sure, we&rsquo;ve have a Tory government for thirteen years but the average term of office of each prime minister in this period is 3 years and 116 days - obviously this discounts Liz Truss&rsquo; disastrous escapade as anything other than a mildly ineffectual cabinet minister. Three years is hardly enough time to pass any ground-breaking reform through parliament, let alone get through implementing it. And yet, the parties still promise these things. The selective short-term memory of the media helps the parties to brush any policy failures underneath the carpet and move on to the next big shining plan.</p>
<p>Sometimes, politics needs to be boring; It is the mechanism by which we live our lives. It dictates our ability to earn money, the quality of the housing we live in, the healthcare and education we receive and almost everything in between. The UK needs a little bit of dull policy making to steer things towards a more equitable society and keep the world moving onwards. How we go about persuading the electorate of that, I don&rsquo;t know. But there is real opportunity to change the country for the better one step at a time. Let&rsquo;s start by enabling the poorest to keep more of any changes in income by adjusting the Universal Credit taper, let&rsquo;s push Capital Gains Tax inline with income taxes and expand payment onto all house sales to tax the vast amounts of unearned wealth that has accumulated in property over the past few decades. Incremental change to the systems people interact with daily needs to happen to provide tangible improvements to peoples lives.</p>
